      <p>Welcome to my page ❤️</p>

      <p>
        I'm a software engineer based in the vibrant city of Bangalore ✨,
        hailing from the scenic hills of Darjeeling ⛰️. Graduating from NIT
        Patna 🎓, I embarked on an exciting journey into the world of technology
        👨‍💻.
      </p>

      <p>
        But let me tell you a little secret - my passion goes beyond lines of
        code and algorithms ⚙️. I'm a multifaceted individual with a wide range
        of interests and hobbies 🔥. When I'm not immersed in the digital realm,
        you can find me lost in the pages of captivating books 📚, strumming
        melodies on my trusty ukulele 🎸, and diving into the depths of creative
        programming 🎨.
      </p>

      <p>
        Speaking of books, I have a soft spot for captivating tales that
        transport me to magical realms 🧚. The Wizard of Oz series 🧙‍♂️, The
        Alchemist 🏜️, and Ender's Game 🌌 have all left an indelible mark on my
        imagination and shaped my perspective on life's journeys 🌱.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond my personal pursuits, I strive for a kinder world ❤️. I believe
        that small acts of kindness have the power to create ripples of
        positivity 🤟, and I'm committed to spreading joy and compassion
        wherever I go 😊.

# Personal Landing Page

## Purpose

The purpose of this page would be to tell the visitor about me: 
- Where I am from
- What I do
- What I'm currently doing

And to let them connect with me if they want. 

I will add a photo of me at one side. Which I don't really want to but I see that most other personal lading page websites have done.

## Structure

It is recommened to add a header but there's only going to be a single page so I don't know what I would add there. So I'll not be using that.

There is going to be an image, probably on one side of the page for large screens and linearly placed for smaller screens. 

There will be an about me text content. On the right side of the image and below the image depending upon if its a large or a small screen. 

There will be a list of social media icons laied out horizontally that lead to my social media pages. 

I'm going to use emojis too.
